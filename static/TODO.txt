TODOs:

* Finish converting /delete route
* Handle merge after signin of books
* Handle duplication/existing books

* Pass along username and password to Register page if entered in Login page.
* Look into a library for form validation...
* If book is already in list, replace Save button with Checkmark icon (and don't let them add it again).
